    <p> In my work I conceptualize the complexities of identity through relationships with self, others, culture, and environment.
</p>
<p>
I utilize my perspective to create imagery that evokes dialog between the viewer and my work. Throughout my work I investigate the complexity of intersecting identities. I am intrigued by human connection through relationships. I choose to only photograph and represent queer and/or people of color because throughout history marginalized groups have not been given visibility or voice. Through my photography, I emphasize cultural significance and the manifestation of time in relationship with identity.

In the future, I am eager to explore concepts through minimalism and alternative processes. As a career path, I am interested in displaying my work in galleries and collaborating with other artists within my communities.
