  <body>
    <p> In my work I conceptualize the complexities of identity through relationships and culture.
</p>
<p>
 As a queer latinx person, I utilize my perspective to create imagery that evokes dialog between the viewer and my photographs. Throughout my work I investigate the complexity of intersecting identities. I am intrigued by human connection through relationships within their environment and other humans. I choose to only photograph queer and/or people of color because throughout history marginalized groups have not been given visibility or voice. Through my photography, I emphasize cultural significance and the manifestation of time in relationship with identity.
</p>
<p>
In the first three images, I explore the concept of intimate connectivity via the body and its form. I focus on the intricacy and resilience of queer bodies of color. The next set of images represent cultural individuality through self-expression. Lastly, the ending set of  images are a concept I am currently exploring. These images were done in 120mm film with a Mamiya C330, and this was my first time utilizing 120mm film. I am excited to explore alternative processes in the future and will continue expanding my creativity with analog photography.
</p>

<p>
In the future, I am eager to explore concepts through minimalism and alternative processes. As a career path, I am interested in displaying my work in galleries and collaborating with other artists within my communities.
